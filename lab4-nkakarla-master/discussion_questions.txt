1. I expect the delay to grow linearly with the number of inputs.
I think this because the capacitance will grow and therefore create a longer delay
. This was correct. For example the 128 bit was over double the 64 bit adder

2. Since we are now optimized for delay, the smart inverter insertions will occur.
Since we optimzie for delay, I would expect the program to be smarter and decrease the increase more.
The reality did not match my expectations since the delay from 64 to 128 actually decreased.

3. When the multisize is used, we are able to use larger gates. This allows for much smaller delay as well as slightly smaller area
than the original library

4. Here are the numbers

ALU:
    Gates: 1371
    Area: 1264.56 um^2
    Critical-path delay: 671.79 ps

AddSub:
    Gates: 256
    Area: 372.13 um^2
    Critical-path delay: 610.98 ps

lt32:
    Gates: 209
    Area: 202.16 um^2
    Critical-path delay: 236.96 ps

sft32:
    Gates: 209
    Area: 202.16 um^2
    Critical-path delay: 236.96 ps


5. The delay is longer but area is lower for the regular one. 
Therefore, I think it makes more sense to use the regular one
This is because it will be used many time and the delay difference is not that much 
while the area difference is very larger.
